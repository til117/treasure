# treasure
A simple MATLAB program that calculates and plots (in 2D and 3D) the quickest way from point A to point B (the treasure!)

Just run the file Guldskatten.m for the 2D version, or the Del3D.m for the 3D extension.

More details and an implementation can be found in the pdf file "Projektrapport" (in swedish).
